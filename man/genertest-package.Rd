Store your questions in a tab delimited database and use function genertest() to generate tests. Specify the topics of the questions to be included in the exams, the number of completely different or permuted exams to be generated; many other options are available. 
The output is a LaTeX or PDF file for each generated test. 
Function write.all() writes on a file that has the same structure as the exams all the questions included in the database; merge.pdf() can be used to merge PDF files containing different exams in a single file.
