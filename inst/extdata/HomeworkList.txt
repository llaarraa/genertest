A genetically modified mouse does not survive the first month of life with probability \Sexpr{p} ."	15th of October 2012	3	Probability.doc	Young group of students
			 We planned an experiment that included \Sexpr{n} mice. What is the probability that after a month not more than a mouse will survive?				
			What is the expected number of mice still alive after the first month?				
			"Is the animal represented in the picture a genetically modified mouse?
