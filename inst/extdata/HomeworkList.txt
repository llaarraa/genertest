A genetically modified mouse does not survive the first month of life with probability \Sexpr{p} ."		15th of October 2012	3	Probability.doc	Young group of students
			 We planned an experiment that included \Sexpr{n} mice. What is the probability that after a month not more than a mouse will survive?	"$X=1$ survive, $P(X=1)=p=\Sexpr{1-p}, n=\Sexpr{n}, Y=sum(X), P(Y<=1)=P(Y=0)+P(Y=1)=(1-p)^n+n*p(1-p)^(n-1)$ -> $P(Y<=1)= \Sexpr{ round(pbinom(1, n, 1-p), 3)}$.
}$"				
			What is the expected number of mice still alive after the first month?	$E(X)=pn -> E(X)=\Sexpr{round(n*p,2)}$				
			"Is the animal represented in the picture a genetically modified mouse?
